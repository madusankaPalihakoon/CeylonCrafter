Sri Lanka is an island country located in South Asia and is surrounded by the Indian Ocean. It doesn't consist of other islands as part of its sovereign territory. However, there are a few small islands and islets off the coast of Sri Lanka that are of interest:

1. **Pigeon Island:** Located off the east coast near Nilaveli, Pigeon Island is known for its coral reefs and marine life. It's a popular spot for snorkeling and diving.

2. **Delft Island:** Situated in the Jaffna Peninsula in the north, Delft Island is known for its wild horses and Dutch colonial ruins.

3. **Mannar Island:** Connected to the mainland by a causeway, Mannar Island is known for its natural beauty, birdlife, and historical sites.

4. **Adam's Bridge (Rama's Bridge):** A chain of limestone shoals between Rameswaram Island in India and Mannar Island in Sri Lanka. It is of historical and cultural significance.

While these are some notable islands and islets, the main island of Sri Lanka itself is the primary landmass and the focus of most tourism and cultural activities. The surrounding sea offers opportunities for beach activities, water sports, and exploration of marine life.
